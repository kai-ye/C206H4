    <td class="catalogue">This scenic hideout, located within the Himalayan mountains, is the perfect place to plot your evil schemes. The mountaintop view gives good range of vision, making it hard to be surprised, and the remote location ensures that only the most obstinate of meddlesome interlopers will be able to reach you. Another plus, if your doomsday scheme involves global flooding, you won't havbe to relocate, as this fortress is located at over 3000 feet above sea level! </td>

    <td class="catalogue">This lair is located on the mencaing "Gauntlet Isle". Strong tides that bash stray ships among the reefs make this island an especially fortifiable one, and waters teeming with sharks and manta rays provide for amuzing and deadly ways to deal with your foes. There is also room in the stone face for a hidden rocket launching facility, but the previous owner allowed it to fall into disrepair, meaning it will take a bit of handiwork to get the site fully functioning again  </td>

    <td class="catalogue">Like the skin of your enemies, This majestic superlair will melt your heart as soon as you see it. The base is located in a volcano, <i> inside another, larger volcano!</i> Quite frankly, if you don't find that enough of a reason to aqquire this incredibly rare property, then I don't know what is. The facility comes included with its own armory, tailor made to be able to fend off any attacks from the fauna that live in the incredibly hostile jungle below. The volcanoes have been predicted to erupt in about 1000 years (give or take about a thousand), so we're giving all interested buyers a discount of 50%!  </td>
