Strong tides that bash stray ships among the reefs make this island an especially fortifiable one, and waters teeming with sharks and manta rays provide for amuzing and deadly ways to deal with your foes. There is also room in the stone face for a hidden rocket launching facility, but the previous owner allowed it to fall into disrepair, meaning it will take a bit of handiwork to get the site fully functioning again "

The base is located in a volcano, <i> inside another, larger volcano!</i> Quite frankly, if you don't find that enough of a reason to aqquire this incredibly rare property, then I don't know what is.
